# Detecting Skin cancer using deep learning methods

The project is about utilizing deep learning methods to identify skin cancer indicators and distinguish it from other skin related conditions. In my project I've used a CNN and ResNet model to detect melanoma across the images provided. The objective is to ensure that the model is able to distinguish melanoma from other indicators such as. Kurtosis. 

The project is measured in terms of accuracy, precision and recall score. Moreover, the model deploys a rigorous training an validation loop and prioritizes reducing the training loss figure from 0.1831 and validation loss from 0.3802.

There are sitll big improvements needed to improve its predictability which could be accomplished by having a larger sample dataset for melanoma images, more hyperparameter tuning etc. For the model to improve in terms of accuracy, the AI models need to be trained on diverse datasets. The existing available data is based on more Caucasian skin types versus darker skin. This makes the model vulnerable towards unseen data and reduces its predictability.

However, these models could be used for early detection of skin cancer. Users can more easily scan skin lesions using the algorithm and then consult professionals. This also reduces healthcare costs dedicated towards biopsies. This could be useful in the long term to detect any skin deficiencies.

The dataset and a reference point that I used for my project can be found in this kaggle project: https://www.kaggle.com/code/sharanharsoor/skin-cancer-detection/notebook
